# How to Add More Data

name. (Please use the date 2014-01-01 in the file name.) There is a template in
that folder. Then submit a pull request.

You do not need to document every end point in the API, in fact for some of the
larger APIs, it would be better if you specifically call out the endpoints that
are likely to be the most useful.
